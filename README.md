## Question : Is E-Sports taking over traditional sports in the US? (Brandon Loredo)
Jupyter Notebook: Project 1.ipynb (Branch - Brandon)

This section compares the earnings betweeon eSports and Active sports earners from the years 2013 to 2021.

1. Processing Data and Cleaning
* All datasets were found on kaggle/esportsearnings (link under references). 

2. Data Visualizations
* Graphed top 10 earners for both esports and active sports for the years 2013-2021 
* Graphed the average top 10 earners for both esports and active sports for the years 2013-2021
* Graphed multiple boxplots/scatter plots to show the distribution of earnings by years

3. Analysis
* Both have a positive slope, which suggest an increase in earnings over time and potential future growth.

* T-test between top 10 earners for both E-sports and Active sports: 
** T-Statistic: -17.67153631041991
** P-Value: 5.132170911238922e-41

4. Conclusion
* Based on the t-statistic and the very small p-value, we can infer that there is a statistically significant difference in earnings between the top 10 esports earners and the top 10 active sports earners. 
* The negative t-statistic suggests that the average earnings of the top 10 esports earners are lower than the average earnings of the top 10 active sports earners. 
* The extremely small p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis of equal average earnings between the two groups.
